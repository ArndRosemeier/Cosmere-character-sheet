#### Validation Messages
The sheet shows three types of messages:

1. **⚠ Issues to fix** (red box)

   - Example: "You have used 2 too many attribute points"
   - Fix these first!

2. **ℹ Recommendations** (yellow box)
   - These are optional but recommended
   - Example: "Consider adding a Purpose for your character"

## 🎯 Point Trackers

### Attribute Points
Shows: **Used / Total** (e.g., "8 / 10" means 2 remaining)

**Rules:**
- New characters start with **10 attribute points**
- Each attribute can be 0-5
- You gain more points when leveling up (at levels 3, 5, 7, 9)
- The progress bar turns:
  - **Green** when you've used exactly the right amount
  - **Red** if you've used too many
  - **Gray** if you have points left

**Common Mistake:** Using too many or too few points. The tracker will warn you!

### Skill Ranks
Shows: **Used / Total** (e.g., "4 / 12" means 8 remaining)

**Rules:**
- Level 1 characters get **0 skill ranks** (you start with untrained skills)
- Level 2+ characters gain **2 ranks per level**
- Each skill can have 0-5 ranks
- Skill modifier = Attribute + Rank

**Tips:**
- Spread ranks across multiple skills, or specialize in a few
- Focus on skills that match your Heroic Path
- Skills tied to higher attributes give better modifiers

## 📝 Step-by-Step Character Creation

### Step 1: Basic Information
1. Enter your **Character Name**
2. Enter your name as **Player Name**
3. Select **Ancestry** (Human, Singer, Horneater, etc.)
4. Select **Culture** (Alethi, Veden, Thaylen, etc.)

### Step 2: Distribute Attribute Points
You start with all attributes at **2** (12 points total). You can redistribute these among 6 attributes:

**Physical Realm:**
- **Strength** - Physical power, Heavy Weapons, Athletics
- **Speed** - Quickness, Light Weapons, Agility, Movement

**Cognitive Realm:**
- **Intellect** - Intelligence, Lore, Medicine, Crafting
- **Willpower** - Mental fortitude, Discipline, Intimidation

**Spiritual Realm:**
- **Awareness** - Perception, Insight, Survival, Senses
- **Presence** - Charisma, Persuasion, Leadership

**Recommended Distributions:**
- **Balanced**: 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 (default - versatile character)
- **Focused**: 4, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0 (specialist in 1-2 areas)
- **Warrior**: STR 4, SPD 3, WIL 2, rest 1 each
- **Scholar**: INT 4, WIL 3, AWA 2, rest 1 each
- **Social**: PRE 4, AWA 3, WIL 2, rest 1 each

### Step 3: Select Heroic Path (Required!)
Choose ONE of six paths:

- **Agent** - Stealth, infiltration, information gathering
- **Envoy** - Diplomacy, social situations
- **Hunter** - Tracking, wilderness survival
- **Leader** - Command, inspiring allies
- **Scholar** - Knowledge, lore, deduction
- **Warrior** - Combat prowess

**Important:** This is REQUIRED. The sheet will warn you until you select one!

### Step 4: Radiant Order (Optional)
Only select if you're playing a Knight Radiant:
- Each order has two Surges (magical powers)
- Requires Investiture points
- Has special oaths and ideals

**Not a Radiant?** Leave this as "None" - that's perfectly fine!

### Step 5: Distribute Skill Ranks
At level 1, you have **0 skill ranks** (you're learning!).

When you level up:
- Level 2+: Gain **2 skill ranks per level**
- Maximum **5 ranks** in any skill
- Your modifier = Attribute + Ranks

**Tips:**
- Hover over skills to see their descriptions
- Skill modifier tooltips show the calculation
- Focus on skills that match your path and attributes

### Step 6: Purpose & Obstacle
**Purpose** - What drives your character?
- Example: "Protect my family" or "Uncover ancient secrets"
- Helps define character goals

**Obstacle** - What holds them back?
- Example: "Haunted by past failures" or "Forbidden love"
- Creates interesting roleplay opportunities

**Note:** These are recommended but not required for a valid character.

### Step 7: Set Current Resources
- **Current Health**: Usually equal to max when starting
- **Current Focus**: Usually equal to max when starting
- **Current Investiture**: Only if you're a Radiant
- **Deflect**: From armor (start at 0 if no armor)

## ⚙️ Automatic Calculations

These update instantly - you never have to calculate manually:

### Defenses
- **Physical Defense** = 10 + Strength + Speed
- **Cognitive Defense** = 10 + Intellect + Willpower
- **Spiritual Defense** = 10 + Awareness + Presence

### Resources
- **Max Health** = 10 + (Level × 6)
- **Max Focus** = 5 + (Level × 3)
- **Max Investiture** = 3 + (Level × 1) [Radiants only]

### Derived Stats
- **Movement** = 30 + (Speed × 5) feet
- **Senses Range** = 60 + (Awareness × 10) feet
- **Lifting Capacity** = 100 + (Strength × 50) lbs
- **Recovery Die** = 1d6 (improves at levels 3, 5, 7)

### Skill Modifiers
Every skill shows: **Attribute + Rank**
- Agility: Speed + Agility Ranks
- Medicine: Intellect + Medicine Ranks
- Persuasion: Presence + Persuasion Ranks
- etc.

## ✅ Validation Checklist

The sheet automatically checks:

### Required:
- [ ] Character name entered
- [ ] Attribute points = available points (not over or under)
- [ ] Each attribute ≤ 5
- [ ] Heroic Path selected
- [ ] Skill ranks = available ranks (not over)
- [ ] Each skill rank ≤ 5

### Recommended:
- [ ] Purpose defined
- [ ] Obstacle defined

## 🎮 Common Beginner Mistakes

### "I have too many attribute points!"
**Fix:** Lower some attributes. Remember, you can't exceed 5 in any attribute.

### "I have unspent attribute points"
**Fix:** Distribute them! You're more powerful if you use all available points.

### "I can't add more skill ranks"
**Check:** 
- Are you at level 1? Level 1 characters get 0 skill ranks!
- Have you used all available ranks? Check the tracker.
- Is any skill over 5 ranks? That's the maximum.

### "My defenses aren't updating"
**This should now work automatically!** If not:
- Try changing an attribute value
- The defenses update instantly as you type

### "The sheet says I need a Heroic Path"
**Fix:** Scroll to the "Heroic Path" section and click one of the six options.

### "Do I need a Radiant Order?"
**No!** That's optional. Only select one if you're specifically playing a Knight Radiant character.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Save often**: The sheet auto-saves to your browser, but export to a file for backup!

2. **Hover for help**: Hover over skills and modifiers for tooltips with descriptions.

3. **Use the validation**: The sheet does the math for you - trust the red/yellow/green indicators.

4. **Level up correctly**: When you level up, the sheet tells you exactly what you gain. Don't forget to spend those new points!

5. **Multiple characters**: You can create as many characters as you want. Switch between them in the character list.

6. **Export before major changes**: Before leveling up or making big changes, export your character as a backup.

## 🎲 Using the Dice Roller

The character sheet has **TWO** built-in dice rolling systems!

### Method 1: Inline Rolling (Fastest! ⚡)
**NEW in v1.4:** Click dice buttons directly on your sheet!

**Where to find them:**
- **Every skill** has a 🎲 button next to its modifier
- **Every attribute** has a 🎲 button next to its value
- **Every defense** has a 🎲 button next to the number
- **Recovery Die** has a large "🎲 Roll" button

**How it works:**
1. See a 🎲 button next to a value
2. Click it
3. Toast notification pops up with result (top-right)
4. Result auto-dismisses after 3 seconds
5. Still saves to roll history

**Example:**
```
Your Athletics is +5
→ Click 🎲 next to it
→ Toast appears: "Athletics Test: 18 (1d20+5)"
→ Auto-dismisses
→ Keep playing!
```

**Perfect for:**
- Quick skill checks
- Attribute tests
- Recovery rolls during rest
- Rapid rolling during combat

### Method 2: Full Dice Roller

4. **Track resources** by updating Current Health/Focus/Investiture
5. **Reference skill modifiers** when making tests (or use quick skill rolls!)
6. **Update after sessions** - add notes, adjust resources, gain levels
